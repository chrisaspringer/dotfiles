# PHP Xdebug

## Installation

Xdebug is installed automatically via the Homebrew shell script but finalizing the configuration requires a few manual steps.

[Debugging: Configure VS Code + XDebug + PHPUnit](https://tighten.co/blog/configure-vscode-to-debug-phpunit-tests-with-xdebug) will provide you with the full process. Customizing your terminal is the one item that requires manual activity.
