# Software Installation

## Installation Scripts
The following installation scripts exist to automate installation of software via Homebrew and Composer.

You will need to make sure you have installed both Homebrew and Composer before executing these scripts.
```
/Users/$USER/dotfiles/install/composer/install.sh
/Users/$USER/dotfiles/install/homebrew/install.sh
```

## Manual Installation
The following software applications can be installed via instructions found within Markdown files in the `install` folder. Note that steps for installation may have changed since these files were created.

* Composer
* Homebrew
* Hubflow
* Node Version Manager (NVM)
* Ruby Version Manager (RVM)
* Sublime Text
* WordPress CLI


## App Store Installations
The following software applications can be installed via the Mac App Store.

* Dash
* Transmit
* Tweetbot


## Installation Packages
I use the following software applications across home and work computers. They must be installed via their installation packages because they either do not have a scripted installation option or I simply haven't found it yet.
