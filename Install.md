# Software Installation

## Foundational Elements

I keep my computers up-to-date via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/). I usually install those items first.

* [Homebrew](https://github.com/dascentral/dotfiles/blob/master/install/homebrew.md)
* [Composer](https://github.com/dascentral/dotfiles/blob/master/install/composer.md)

Once those two have been installed, a bevy of additional software can be installed automatically via the following scripts:

```bash
/Users/${USER}/dotfiles/install/composer/install.sh
/Users/${USER}/dotfiles/install/homebrew/install.sh
```

## Favorites

The following items represent my favorite and most frequently used software applications. I have some special setup instructions that help customize the applications to my liking.

* [iTerm2](https://github.com/dascentral/dotfiles/blob/master/install/favorites/iTerm2.md)
* [Sublime Text](https://github.com/dascentral/dotfiles/blob/master/install/favorites/Sublime.md)

## Additional Items

### Installation via Terminal

Some software applications require manual installation via the command line. I have duplicated instructions within the [install/terminal](https://github.com/dascentral/dotfiles/tree/master/install/terminal) folder of this repo. Note that steps for installation may have changed since these files were created.

### Installation via App Store

I install the following software applications via the Mac App Store.

* Dash
* Transmit
* Tweetbot

### Installation via Package Download

I use the following software applications across home and work computers. They must be installed via their installation packages because they either do not have a scripted installation option or I simply haven't found it yet.
