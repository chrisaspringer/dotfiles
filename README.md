# dotfiles

## Introduction
dotfiles is a series of customizations that help me personalize my system.

The notion of creating such a repo is not my own. Initially I forked a repo from
[Zack Holman](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles) but quickly realized I did not
understand much of what was going on. So instead of simply copying his work and
customizing it for my use, I decided to start from scratch and slowly add
functionality so that I could better understand what Zack or others have done.

No doubt many of the conventions leveraged were inspired by or copied
directly from Zack's repo. Credit where credit is due.

If you're interested in the philosophy behind why projects like these are
awesome, you might want to [read Zack's post on the
subject](http://zachholman.com/2010/08/dotfiles-are-meant-to-be-forked/).


## Repository Contents
Rather than exhaustively list the applications or software that is installed
within this README, I have tried to add comments to the scripts that live
within this repository.

It is likely easiest for you to browse contents of the repo to better
understand what is accomplished via the installation script.
