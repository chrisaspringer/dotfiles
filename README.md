dotfiles
=============

## Introduction

dotfiles is a series of customizations that help me personalize my system.

The notion of creating such a repo is not my own. Initially I forked a repo
from [Zack Holman](https://github.com/holman) but quickly realized I did not
understand much of what was going on. So instead of simply copying his work
and customizing it for my use, I decided to start from scratch and slowly
add functionality so that I could better understand what Zack had done.

No doubt many of the conventions leveraged were inspired by or copied
directly from Zack's repo. Credit where credit is due.

If you're interested in the philosophy behind why projects like these are
awesome, you might want to [read Zack's post on the
subject](http://zachholman.com/2010/08/dotfiles-are-meant-to-be-forked/).
