# iTerm2

## Overview
As I was setting up a new Mac, I realized iTerm2 offers the ability to save settings
within a local file. I have stored my preferences on Dropbox and have configured
my latest iTerm2 installation to leverage that file.

I am currently unsure if that settings file handles ALL options within the
"Preferences" dialog. I'll keep the notes below around for a while until
I am able to confirm.
