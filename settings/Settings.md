# Manual Configurations
While I would love for all settings to be controlled programmatically, I just
haven't had time to find the necessary commands. This folder contains an
inventory of the manual customizations I make for various applications.

## iTerm2
*As I was setting up a new Mac, I realized iTerm2 offers the ability to save settings
within a local file. I have stored my preferences on Dropbox and have configured
my latest iTerm2 installation to leverage that file.*

*I am currently unsure if that settings file handles ALL options within the
"Preferences" dialog. I'll keep the notes below around for a while until
I am able to confirm.*
